# What is CloudRETIC?

CloudRETIC is an upcoming company focused on providing high-quality care to reptiles through a cloud-based environmental management platform.

## Why open source?

We firmly believe that open source makes better solutions. We strive for effective, maintainable, and modular code, which lends itself well to the publicization of individual components, and more than anything we want to give back to a community that has so often supported our work.
